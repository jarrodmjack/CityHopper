Style grid cards (make property card component)

I would like to add a "propertySearch" that is linked to a user. Will just contain the search that they made so they can see what was included.
I think it will look something like this:
propertySearch {
    userId,
    foundLocations: [array of locations that they had previously found with their query(eg. Toronto, 2023-06-12, 2023-06-17, 2)]
}
I would then use these previously found searches in some sort of side-bar menu on the front page so they can click on it and bring these back up again
